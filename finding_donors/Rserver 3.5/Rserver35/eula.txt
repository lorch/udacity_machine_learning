         the specified version of the Software on a specified number of
         computers, workstations, personal digital assistants, "smart phones",
         mobile phones, hand-held devices, or other electronic devices for

         accept such License as follows:

         a). Trial Version.
             If you have received, downloaded and/or installed a trial
             version of the Product and are hereby granted an evaluation
             license for the Software and you may Use the Product only for
             evaluation purposes and only during the single applicable
             evaluation period of thirty (30) days, unless otherwise

             of the Product for other purposes or beyond the applicable
             evaluation period is strictly prohibited, provided however that,
             subject to the restrictions contained herein, you may copy and
             distribute a trial version of the Software without any
             modifications whatsoever to any third party subject to this
             Agreement.

         b). Single License.
             Upon payment for the License and registration of the Product,
             you are granted a non-exclusive and non-transferable License to
             install and Use one (1) copy of the Product and during the Term

             one (1) copy of the specified version of the Product, on one
             Client Device provided that you and any of your employees, if
             any, may simultaneously create up to a maximum of five (5)
             Connections to the Product without regard to as to how many your
             organization's employees are actually so Connected, and further
             provided that for purposes of Operating the Product the
             additional software called Radmin Viewer may be needed.
             Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Radmin Viewer
             is subject to a separate End User License Agreement.
             Additionally, the individual licensing terms may specify other
             terms, conditions and restrictions of Using of the Product.

         c). Help Desk License.
             If the Product is licensed with "Help Desk" license terms
             specified in the applicable product invoicing or packaging for
             the Product, you may install and Operate as many copies of the
             Product on the number of Client Devices owned and/or operated by
             your client as such "Help Desk" license terms specify provided
             that for purposes of Operating the Products installed on the
             Client Devices of your clients, the additional Components, as
             defined herein, shall only be installed on the computers of your
             organization ("Connection Terminals") and used solely for
             providing remote technical support and "help desk" services to
             your clients, provided that you may simultaneously create up to
             a maximum of five (5) Connections to the Product from any of
             your Connection Terminals. If the Product is licensed with
             "Help Desk" license terms to a third party licensee specified in
             the applicable product invoicing or packaging for the Product,
             you hereby represent that you are an authorized client or an
             authorized service provider of such licensee and that you are
             authorized to install and Operate this Product on behalf of such
             licensee as provided herein. You must have a reasonable mechanism
             in place to ensure that (i) the number of Client Devices on which
             the Product has been installed does not exceed the number of
             licenses you have obtained, (ii) your client does not
             independently Operate the Product for any other purposes
             except for your performance of "Help Desk" services to such
             client, and (iii) any such copy installed on your client's
             Client Device is uninstalled and deleted upon the termination
             of this Agreement. You shall include this End User License
             Agreement with the Product and shall require each of your
             clients to enter into the End User License Agreement,
             electronically or otherwise, as a condition precedent to
             the first use of the Product.

         d). Grant of Multiple Licenses.
             If you have purchased multiple licenses for the Product, as
             reflected the License Key File granted to you by the Company,
             then the number of multiple licenses and the licensing terms
             reflected in the License Key shall determine the number of
             copies of the Product you may have, the permitted uses, and
             the number of Client Devices on which you may Use the Product
             provided that unless the type of the License and explicit
             licensing terms and the License Key provides otherwise, each
             purchased license entitles you to install and Use the Product
             on one (1) original Client Devices and you may simultaneously
             create up to a maximum of five (5) Connections to the Product
             from any of your Connection Terminals. The Company reserves all
             rights not expressly granted herein.

         e). Additional Client Access Licenses (CALs).
             If you have purchased an additional CAL for the Product, you may
             simultaneously create one (1) additional Connection to the
             Product from any of your Connection Terminals for each CAL
             so acquired.

         f). For the avoidance of doubt the term "original" or
             "originally installed" used in this Section 2.1 or elsewhere in
             this Agreement, means that the License is valid only for the
             Client Device on which the Product was installed and in case
             you desire to Operate the Product on a different Client Device,
             regardless of the reason, a separate License must be purchased
             from the Company for Operating the Product on such other Client
             Device, i.e. the License is not transferable to a new Client
             Device. If you have replaced some hardware parts or components
             of your Client Device and have any questions as to whether your
             Client Device is still considered to be "original" within the
             meaning of this Agreement, you may refer to the criteria
             published on www.radmin.com/about/legal/odc.php

   2.2.  Remote Access.
         The Product contains various technologies that enable other
         applications of third parties installed on a Client Device (the
         "Host Client Device") to be Used or Used remotely from one or more
         other Client Devices. You may need to review your license agreements
         relating to other applicable third parties' applications or products
         to which you may be able to obtain remote access using the Product
         in order to ascertain your compliance with the restrictions and
         limitations of the use of such third parties' applications or
         products, including the use through remote access. You are solely
         responsible for compliance with such third parties' rights and
         obtaining all necessary third parties' licenses or consents.

   2.3.  Components.
         Depending on a license you have chosen, in order to Operate the
         Product you may need additional components, including without
         limitation Radmin 3.5 Viewer (the "Component"). Notwithstanding
         anything to the contrary herein, components that you receive as part
         of the Software may have its own license agreements relating to the
         Component or the Product as a whole (each, a "Component Agreement").
         In the event of inconsistencies between this Agreement and any
         Component Agreement, the terms of the Component Agreement shall
         control except for Confidential Information and Intellectual Property
         provisions.

   2.4.  Multiple Environment Product; Multiple Language Product;
         Dual Media Product; Multiple Copies; Bundles.
         If you use different versions of the Product or different language
         editions of the Product, if you receive the Product on multiple

         or if you received the Product bundled with other software, the total
         permitted number of your Client Devices on which all versions of the
         Product are installed shall correspond to the number of licenses you
         have obtained from the Company provided that unless the licensing
         terms and the License Key provides otherwise, each purchased license
         entitles you to install and Use the Product on one (1) original
         Client Device. You may not rent, lease, sublicense, lend or transfer
         any versions or copies of the Product regardless of whether you use
         the Product or not. You also may not, subsequent to the original
         installation of the Product on the original Client Device, install
         the Product on any other Client Device for any reason.

   2.5.  Updates.

         Product when and as the Company publishes them in its website or
         through other online services. Notwithstanding any provision to the
         contrary herein, nothing is this Agreement shall be construed as to
         grant you any rights or licenses with regard to the New Releases of
         the Product or to entitle you to any New Release. This Agreement does
         not obligate the Company to provide any Updates. Notwithstanding the
         foregoing, any Updates that you may receive become part of the
         Product and the terms of this Agreement apply to them (unless this

         specified in the License granted hereunder. The Company may terminate
         this Agreement by offering you a superseding Agreement for the
         Product or any replacement or modified version of or upgrade or New
         Release of the Product and conditioning your continued use of the
         Product or such replacement, modified or upgraded version or New

         terms and conditions shall constitute sufficient cause for Company to
         immediately terminate this Agreement and the License granted under
         this Agreement. The presence of this Section 2.8 shall not be
         relevant in determining the materiality of any other provision or

         a valid full license to the Original Product and accept the relevant
         License Upgrade Agreement relating to an upgrade from the Original
         Product to the Product in order to Operate the upgrade copy of the
         Product.

         permit any third party to do so, except to the extent the foregoing
         restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law.
         Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, decompiling the Software is

         non-waivable right to do so to obtain information necessary to

         however, that you must first request such information from the

         of copyright. The Company retains the right of claims for
         compensation in respect of damage which occurred by your giving
         away the License Key File or registration code contained therein.
         This claim shall also extend to all costs which the Company of its

4. NO WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER.

   4.1.  Limited Warranty.
         The Company warrants that for sixty (60) days from the earlier of
         i) original purchase of the media (e.g. diskettes) on which the
         Product is contained, or ii) the date the License Key File is
         provided to you by Company, the Product will be free from defects
         in materials and workmanship and that the Software will perform
         substantially in accordance with the Documentation or generally
         conform to the Product's specifications published by the Company.
         Non-substantial variations of performance from the Documentation do
         not establish a warranty right.
         THIS LIMITED WARRANTY DOES NOT APPLY TO TRIAL AND
         EVALUATION VERSIONS, UPDATES, PRE-RELEASE, TRYOUT,
         PRODUCT SAMPLER, OR NOT FOR RESALE (NFR) COPIES OF
         PRODUCT.
         To make a warranty claim, you must return the Product to the location
         where you obtained it along with proof of purchase within such sixty
         (60) day period of the license fee you paid for the Product.
         THE LIMITED WARRANTY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION GIVES
         YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS. YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL
         RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.

   4.2.  Customer Remedies.
         The Company and its suppliers' entire liability and your exclusive
         remedy for any breach of the foregoing warranty shall be at the
         Company's option: (i) return of the purchase price paid for the
         license, if any, (ii) replacement of the defective media in which
         the Product is contained, or (iii) correction of the defects, "bugs"
         or errors within reasonable period of time. You must return the
         defective media to the Company at your expense with a copy of your
         receipt. This limited warranty is void if the defect has resulted
         from accident, abuse, or misapplication. Any replacement media will
         be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period.
         Outside the United States, this remedy may not be available to the
         extent the Company is subject to restrictions under United States
         export control laws and regulations.

6. Your Information and the Company's Privacy Policy.

   6.1.  Privacy Policy.
         You hereby expressly consent to the Company's processing of your
         personal data (which may be collected by the Company or its
         distributors) according to the Company's current privacy policy as
         of the date of the effectiveness hereof which is incorporated into
         this Agreement by reference
         ( see http://www.radmin.com/about/legal/pp.php ). By entering into
         this Agreement, you agree that the Company may collect and retain
         information about you, including your name, email address and credit
         card information. The Company employs other companies and individuals
         to perform functions its behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders,
         delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing
         repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing
         marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing
         customer service. They have access to personal information needed to
         perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. The
         Company publishes a privacy policy on its web site and may amend such
         policy from time to time in its sole discretion. You should refer to
         the Company's privacy policy prior to agreeing to this Agreement for
         a more detailed explanation of how your information will be stored
         and used by the Company. If "you" are an organization, you will

         processing of such personal data. Personal data will be processed
         by the Company or its distributors in the country where it was
         collected, and possibly in the United States and Germany. United
         States laws regarding processing of personal data may be less or
         more stringent than the laws in your jurisdiction.

7. Miscellaneous.

   7.1.  Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue.
         This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in
         accordance with the laws of the British Virgin Islands without
         reference to conflicts of law rules and principles. This Agreement
         shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts
         for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is
         expressly disclaimed and excluded. You agree that this Agreement is
         to be performed in the British Virgin Islands and that any action,
         dispute, controversy, or claim that may be instituted based on this
         Agreement, or arising out of or related to this Agreement or any
         alleged breach thereof, shall be prosecuted exclusively in the
         courts in the British Virgin Islands, and you, to the extent
         permitted by applicable law, hereby waive the right to change venue
         to any other state, county, district or jurisdiction; provided,
         however, that the Company as claimant shall be entitled to initiate
         proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction.

   7.2.  Period for Bringing Actions.
         No action, regardless of form, arising out of the transactions under
         this Agreement, may be brought by either party hereto more than
         one (1) year after the cause of action has occurred, or was
         discovered to have occurred, except that an action for infringement
         of intellectual property rights may be brought within the maximum
         applicable statutory period.

   7.3.  Entire Agreement; Severability; No Waiver.
         This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Company and
         supersedes any other prior agreements, proposals, communications or
         advertising, oral or written, with respect to the Product or to
         subject matter of this Agreement provided that the Company and you
         may limit, modify or changes the applicability of the terms of this
         Agreement by a prior, contemporaneous or subsequent written agreement
         by referencing this Section 7.3 of the Agreement and expressly
         providing for such limitation, modification or changes. You
         acknowledge that you have read this Agreement, understand it and
         agree to be bound by its terms. If any provision of this Agreement
         is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void,
         or unenforceable for any reason, in whole or in part, such provision
         will be more narrowly construed so that it becomes legal and
         enforceable, and the entire Agreement will not fail on account
         thereof and the balance of the Agreement will continue in full force
         and effect to the fullest extent permitted by law. No waiver of any
         breach of any provisions of this Agreement will constitute a waiver
         of any prior, concurrent or subsequent breach and no waiver will be
         effective unless made in writing.

   7.4.  Contact Information.
         Should you have any questions concerning this Agreement, or if you
